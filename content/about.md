### *What is Urbit?*

[Urbit](https://urbit.org/) is:

* a new internet from first principles

* an operating system for sovereign personal computing

* an archipelago of hypercultures

You can read more details [here](https://subject.network/posts/urbit-introduction/), or in the [official documentation](https://urbit.org/docs/).


### *Where can I buy a planet?*

Check out the [store](/buy) -- Bitcoin and **many other coins** accepted via the 'AltCoins' conversion menu option on checkout. Planets are [layer 2](https://urbit.org/docs/azimuth/l2/layer2) and delivered by email after payment is confirmed on-chain.

Never share your planet code or master key! Do not run your ship in two places at the same time, or delete the data folder of a ship that has been booted. Contact  with questions, issues, to arrange batch orders or purchase specific planets.

Buying a planet from NetSub includes technical support to get you set up on request. Planets receive access to technical support on request and free use of `~matwet`'s Bitcoin node for their wallet.

You can run your planet on your PC, a [hosting service](/planet-sales) or a rented Linux server (even a [free one](/posts/free-cloud-oracle/)). Urbit has an official [desktop app](https://urbit.org/getting-started/), and static binaries that run on [Linux, macOS](https://urbit.org/using/install/#macos-and-linux), or [Windows](/posts/urbit-windows-binaries/). 

Networked Subject is one of many independent providers that offer planets and services. You can see more [here](/planet-sales/).


### *What is a planet?*

A planet is an address on the Urbit network meant for an individual instance of Urbit OS, which is cryptographically owned by a person, like Bitcoin. A planet acts as a personal server with an encrypted, P2P stack underpinning all software running on it. A planet has a unique name like `~fanner-ronwyx`; it's like a combination of an email and IP address, and a computer that belongs solely to you forever.

You don't need a planet to try Urbit -- you can launch a free identity called a [comet](https://urbit.org/using/install/#booting-a-comet), that can do *almost* everything a planet can. Download Port, the official and user-friendly client [here](https://urbit.org/getting-started/) for MacOS and Linux. Additional instructions for manual piloting are available for [macOS, Windows & Linux](https://urbit.org/using/install/#macos-and-linux), and running a ship on a [remote server](/posts/free-cloud-oracle/) for free.
