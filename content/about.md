Networked Subject is an independent, boutique [Urbit](https://urbit.org/) star service and a collection of Urbit information and tutorials.

---

### *What is Urbit?*

[Urbit](https://urbit.org/) is:

* an open source platform for sovereign personal computing

* a new internet from first principles

* an archipelago of hypercultures

You can read more details [here](https://subject.network/posts/urbit-introduction/), or in the [official documentation](https://urbit.org/docs/).

### *What is this blog?*

This blog exists as a public face for this star operation, and is intended to be a repository of high quality, maintained information and tutorials related to Urbit. NetSub also has a public group on Urbit: `~matwet/networked-subject`

### *What is a planet?*

A planet is an address on the Urbit network meant for an individual instance of Urbit OS, which is owned by a person cryptographically -- like Bitcoin. A planet acts as a personal server with an encrypted, P2P stack underpinning all software running on it. A planet has a unique name like `~fanner-ronwyx`; it's like a combination of an email and IP address. Planets are issued and 'sponsored' by stars, which perform peer discovery and NAT traversal for them.

### *Do I need a planet to use Urbit?*

Nope! You can use a self-signed urbit called a [comet](https://urbit.org/using/install/#booting-a-comet) that can do *almost* everything a planet can for now. You should spin one up today: you can download Port, the official and user-friendly client [here](https://urbit.org/getting-started/) for MacOS and Linux. Additional instructions for manual piloting are available for [macOS, Linux](https://urbit.org/using/install/#macos-and-linux), [Windows](/posts/urbit-windows-binaries/), and running a ship on a [remote server](/posts/free-cloud-oracle/) for free.

### *What is a star?*

Stars are infrastructure that issue individual addresses and perform peer discovery and other services for those addresses on the Urbit network. Networked Subject hosts a star called `~matwet`. For now, `~matwet` remains local-scale and hobby-grade, but is hosted in a high-uptime datacenter and will develop organically to service its residents.

### *Can I buy a planet from you?*

Yes! 20USD in ETH or BTC for a random planet; 40USD for a specific one. Join `~matwet/networked-subject`, DM `~sitful-hatred`, or DM [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/_matwet).

Buying a planet includes basic technical support to get you set up, but Networked Subject does not presently offer hosting -- you'll need to run it on your PC or a rented Linux server (which can be done [for free](/posts/free-cloud-oracle/)). Urbit has an official desktop [GUI app](https://urbit.org/getting-started/), and static binaries that run on [Linux, macOS](https://urbit.org/using/install/#macos-and-linux), or [Windows](/posts/urbit-windows-binaries/). 

Networked Subject is one of multiple independent providers that offer planets and services. You can see more [here](/planet-sales/).
