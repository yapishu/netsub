Below is a non-authoritative list of known Urbit providers. Note that this information is not definitive for any provider besides Networked Subject. If you have a correction, or are aware of a provider that isn't listed here, please let us know.

Transaction fees for claiming and transferring address ownership are currently very high; work is underway to implement a system to reduce fees by 65-100x, which should be in place later this year. You can read more details [here](https://18108973658826589741.googlegroups.com/attach/31d6ad2570085/naive-for-martians.txt?part=0.1&view=1&vt=ANaJVrGwLVmI_kj1khrOhJPJNMIQgFZgvXy5bCadXrWuoON7tfcwN2s6N9bYS4QCsh0JNyk0d34XzD-MWQfm6wVufkctoWcU1Qr_c2w5WwcJtUbTAngzVrk). Remember that you don't need a planet to use Urbit! You can [boot a comet](https://urbit.org/using/install/#booting-a-comet) for free today, even [on Windows](https://subject.network/posts/urbit-windows-binaries/), and even [hosted](https://subject.network/posts/free-cloud-oracle/) on a server for free.

Be sure to check whether your sponsor is online before purchase, or you will have diminished or no ability to communicate with the rest of the network! `~matwet` resident `~hodzod-walrus` has built a monitoring system with live information about sponsor connectivity [here](https://bacrys.org/uptime/). Hosting & sponsorship fees refer to recurring costs denoted in monthly rate.

You can find directions for going from purchase to booting [here](https://subject.network/posts/accepting-point/). Note that to take possession of an address after purchasing a planet from any provider, you will need an additional small amount of ETH to pay transaction fees to transfer your planet to a paper wallet before you can download a keyfile necessary to boot for the first time. If you opt for full hosting, this step is not necessary unless you want to run your planet yourself.
