Below is a non-authoritative list of known Urbit providers. Note that this information is not definitive for any provider besides Networked Subject. If you have a correction, or are aware of a provider that isn't listed here, please let us know.

Be sure to check whether your sponsor is online before purchase, or you will have diminished or no ability to communicate with the rest of the network! Hosting & sponsorship fees refer to recurring costs denoted in monthly rate.

Remember that you don't need a planet to try Urbit! You can [boot a comet](https://urbit.org/using/install/#booting-a-comet) for free today, even [on Windows](https://github.com/urbit/port/releases), and even [hosted](https://subject.network/posts/free-cloud-oracle/) on a server for free.

**Check whether you are buying a planet on Layer 1 or Layer 2** before purchase. Layer 1 planets invoke Ethereum transaction fees that typically exceed the value of a planet.
You can find directions for going from purchase to booting a Layer 1 planet [here](https://subject.network/posts/accepting-point/). Planets spawned on [Layer 2](https://urbit.org/blog/layer-2-guides) do not require any crypto wallet management.
