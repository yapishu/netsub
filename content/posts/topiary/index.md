This isn't a proper post, but rather a small announcement. I recently wrote [an essay](https://urbit.org/blog/a-topiary/) that was published on the urbit.org blog, which I will link here rather than repost. It is a modest attempt at contextualizing Urbit within the history of hypertext and hypermedia, and in particular their relation to [%graph-store](/posts/graph-store/). 

A big thank you to all those who provided feedback and edited it -- particularly Matt, L, James and Hadden.
