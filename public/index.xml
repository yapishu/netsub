      <description>This blog has been quiet for a few months, but you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t confuse that with a lack of activity.
I was awarded the opportunity to fulfill a grant for the Urbit Foundation, doing writing for urbit.org. You can see the first results here &amp;ndash; the Star operators&amp;rsquo; guide and Galaxy operators&amp;rsquo; guide, on the new Operators microsite. During the summer I was very graciously hosted on an episode of The Stack, a podcast about Urbit.</description>

      <title>Essay: A Topiary</title>
      <link>https://subject.network/posts/topiary/</link>

      <description>This isn&amp;rsquo;t a proper post, but rather a small announcement. I recently wrote an essay that was published on the urbit.org blog, which I will link here rather than repost. It is a modest attempt at contextualizing Urbit within the history of hypertext and hypermedia, and in particular their relation to %graph-store.
A big thank you to all those who provided feedback and edited it &amp;ndash; particularly Matt, L, James and Hadden.</description>

      <title>Configuring your Urbit Bitcoin wallet</title>
      <link>https://subject.network/posts/btc-wallet-config/</link>

      <guid>https://subject.network/posts/btc-wallet-config/</guid>
      <description>Late 2021 Note: This guide is now largely outmoded; %btc-wallet now comes installed out of the box and does not need to be manually installed; the dojo commands have been updated.    The day has finally arrived: May 27 saw a major update to Urbit, and the public release of a bitcoin wallet and the ability to send and receive payments. Your ship provides an identity layer on top of bitcoin &amp;ndash; you can tell your planet to send money to ~sampel-palnet, and Urbit takes care of the rest.</description>

      <title>Building native Windows Urbit binaries</title>
      <link>https://subject.network/posts/urbit-windows-binaries/</link>

      <description>Late 2021 Note: This guide is now largely outmoded; Urbit now has official Windows binaries, and Port now has a native Windows installer    Last month, a PR was published by locpyl-tidnyd to the Urbit Github, containing instructions and a build environment for the compilation of static, Windows-native Urbit executables(!), for the eventual purpose of an official Windows binary distribution. I am frankly amazed that this is even possible.</description>

      <description>Urbit&amp;rsquo;s networking protocol, %ames, uses peer-to-peer connections to let your ship talk to others, with all traffic transported over encrypted UDP. However, in order to allow your ship to discover the IP addresses of ships you want to talk to, you have to query the network &amp;ndash; specifically, your ship asks your star, which asks the galaxies. The answer gets relayed to you, and then you send your packets where they&amp;rsquo;re meant to go.</description>

      <title>State of Mars: Spring 2021</title>

      <description>Introduction In lieu of a tutorial or interview, I thought it would be useful to write a short summary of some of the developments surrounding Urbit in the last year. 2020-21 has been an eventful period for many reasons, but the pace of development on the Urbit project has been steady, and always in the direction of beauty and utility.
When I polled a chat group about their favorite recent improvements and features, several people mentioned its improved reliability, especially chat.</description>
