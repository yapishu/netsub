      <description>So, somebody has offered you an urbit; how do you accept it?
If you aren&amp;rsquo;t familiar with managing Ethereum tokens, this might seem a bit confusing. I promise it&amp;rsquo;s pretty easy, but does require a short walkthrough if you are not experienced with managing crypto tokens. I will try to be as clear as possible in my instructions without getting lost in the technical weeds.
Note that this process is not necessary should you opt for hosted services, or should you decide to run a comet.</description>
