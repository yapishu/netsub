      <description>For a few months, a new piece of architecture has been quietly added to Urbit. A component called %graph-store has been rolled out to replace the bespoke databases previously used by the chat, publish, and link collection apps. The design and development of %graph-store was spearheaded by ~tacryt-socryp, a Tlon employee.
In brief, %graph-store is a flexible, interoperable database format purpose-built to accomodate social software. It&amp;rsquo;s urbit-native, but can be programmed and queried externally like any other database.</description>
