      <description>One of the first tutorials written for this site was a rundown on setting up an https reverse proxy for your Urbit using Nginx and Letsencrypt. Nginx and LE are fantastic pieces of software, but steps involved may seem a little intimidating if you&amp;rsquo;ve never set up a web server before.
In the last couple of weeks, a few people around the network (thanks ~silsyn-wathep!) have suggested using Caddy (alt. Caddyserver), a very lightweight and fast HTTP server suite.</description>

      <description>Continuing our convention of instructions for running your ship on DigitalOcean (referral), this document will guide you through using DO&amp;rsquo;s S3-equivalent service with your ship.
Introduction First a brief explainer &amp;ndash; S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a system for storing and retreiving objects in the cloud. The &amp;lsquo;official&amp;rsquo; S3 is run by Amazon, but other providers run compatible services &amp;ndash; DO&amp;rsquo;s is called Spaces, and it is built to be interchangeable with AWS S3&amp;rsquo;s API.</description>
