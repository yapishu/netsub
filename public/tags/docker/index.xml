      <description>Late 2021 Note: This guide is now largely outmoded; Urbit now has official Windows binaries, and Port now has a native Windows installer    Introduction We&amp;rsquo;ve previously covered a method for running Urbit on a Windows PC, but it could be a little onerous for a novice. Specifically, it still involved a decent amount of command line Linux administration. Fortunately, it turns out there is an easier way to do things; recently, ~botter-nidnul wrote up a guide to running Urbit inside a container with Docker Desktop, and with his blessing I am going to elaborate on it with step-by-step instructions.</description>
