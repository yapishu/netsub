      <description>This isn&amp;rsquo;t a proper post, but rather a small announcement. I recently wrote an essay that was published on the urbit.org blog, which I will link here rather than repost. It is a modest attempt at contextualizing Urbit within the history of hypertext and hypermedia, and in particular their relation to %graph-store.
A big thank you to all those who provided feedback and edited it &amp;ndash; particularly Matt, L, James and Hadden.</description>

      <description>Note: this is a copy of a presentation initially posted on my personal blog. I am posting it here in the interest of centralizing Urbit-related content that I produce.
This essay was written to be given as a presentation at the (temporarily suspended) Urbit DFW meetup group. You can watch it on youtube here.
introduction Urbit is a personal server. that is to say, it&amp;rsquo;s a computer acts as an agent on your behalf to talk to other computers on the internet.</description>
