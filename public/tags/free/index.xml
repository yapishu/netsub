      <description>Background This tutorial will walk you through the process of configuring MinIO on your server, which will allow you to host images and content for your ship, but without relying on or paying for a third party host.
S3 is a service offered by Amazon&amp;rsquo;s web service division that allows you to cheaply host data that you can programatically access with other applications. S3 is wildly popular, and as a result has an API that is widely supported by a lot of software.</description>

      <title>Free Urbit hosting with Oracle Cloud</title>

      <description>Background The two main options for running your Urbit are either to host it on a PC you have at home, or to host it in the cloud in a datacenter. The latter option is appealing thanks to high availability and good connection speed, along with the fact that most people don&amp;rsquo;t have a Linux or Mac computer at home that is always on. A server usually costs a little bit of money, though &amp;ndash; typically on the order of 5-10USD/month.</description>
