      <description>Background The two main options for running your Urbit are either to host it on a PC you have at home, or to host it in the cloud in a datacenter. The latter option is appealing thanks to high availability and good connection speed, along with the fact that most people don&amp;rsquo;t have a Linux or Mac computer at home that is always on. A server usually costs a little bit of money, though &amp;ndash; typically on the order of 5-10USD/month.</description>
