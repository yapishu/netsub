      <description>This isn&amp;rsquo;t a proper post, but rather a small announcement. I recently wrote an essay that was published on the urbit.org blog, which I will link here rather than repost. It is a modest attempt at contextualizing Urbit within the history of hypertext and hypermedia, and in particular their relation to %graph-store.
A big thank you to all those who provided feedback and edited it &amp;ndash; particularly Matt, L, James and Hadden.</description>
