      <description>Note: this is a copy of a presentation initially posted on my personal blog. I am posting it here in the interest of centralizing Urbit-related content that I produce.
This essay was written to be given as a presentation at the (temporarily suspended) Urbit DFW meetup group. You can watch it on youtube here.
