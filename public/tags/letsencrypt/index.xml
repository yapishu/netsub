      <description>One of the first tutorials written for this site was a rundown on setting up an https reverse proxy for your Urbit using Nginx and Letsencrypt. Nginx and LE are fantastic pieces of software, but steps involved may seem a little intimidating if you&amp;rsquo;ve never set up a web server before.
In the last couple of weeks, a few people around the network (thanks ~silsyn-wathep!) have suggested using Caddy (alt. Caddyserver), a very lightweight and fast HTTP server suite.</description>

      <description>As part of a project to document how I use Urbit and the things I learn along the way, I&amp;rsquo;m going to document the process of setting up this site. In its current state, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty simple &amp;ndash; a static site using a modified template (Hugo and Hermit), served from a Digital Ocean Ubuntu VPS (referral link).
Behind the scenes, there are a couple of extra features &amp;ndash; I wanted to be able to access my planet as a subdomain over SSL (proxied from my home PC), and I wanted to run ~matwet under the hood on the same VPS, also accessible on a subdomain.</description>
