      <description>Urbit is a manifestation of the cypherpunk ethos &amp;ndash; your communication is relayed through a decentralized network, with all traffic encrypted all the time. Well, most of the time; it&amp;rsquo;s not encrypted at rest, meaning physical access to your device means full access to its history.
