      <description>Urbit&amp;rsquo;s networking protocol, %ames, uses peer-to-peer connections to let your ship talk to others, with all traffic transported over encrypted UDP. However, in order to allow your ship to discover the IP addresses of ships you want to talk to, you have to query the network &amp;ndash; specifically, your ship asks your star, which asks the galaxies. The answer gets relayed to you, and then you send your packets where they&amp;rsquo;re meant to go.</description>
