      <description>Background This tutorial will walk you through the process of configuring MinIO on your server, which will allow you to host images and content for your ship, but without relying on or paying for a third party host.
S3 is a service offered by Amazon&amp;rsquo;s web service division that allows you to cheaply host data that you can programatically access with other applications. S3 is wildly popular, and as a result has an API that is widely supported by a lot of software.</description>

      <description>Continuing our convention of instructions for running your ship on DigitalOcean (referral), this document will guide you through using DO&amp;rsquo;s S3-equivalent service with your ship.
Introduction First a brief explainer &amp;ndash; S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a system for storing and retreiving objects in the cloud. The &amp;lsquo;official&amp;rsquo; S3 is run by Amazon, but other providers run compatible services &amp;ndash; DO&amp;rsquo;s is called Spaces, and it is built to be interchangeable with AWS S3&amp;rsquo;s API.</description>
