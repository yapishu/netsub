      <description>Late 2021 Note: This guide is now largely outmoded; Urbit now has official Windows binaries, and Port now has a native Windows installer    Last month, a PR was published by locpyl-tidnyd to the Urbit Github, containing instructions and a build environment for the compilation of static, Windows-native Urbit executables(!), for the eventual purpose of an official Windows binary distribution. I am frankly amazed that this is even possible.</description>

      <description>Late 2021 Note: This guide is now largely outmoded; Urbit now has official Windows binaries, and Port now has a native Windows installer    Introduction We&amp;rsquo;ve previously covered a method for running Urbit on a Windows PC, but it could be a little onerous for a novice. Specifically, it still involved a decent amount of command line Linux administration. Fortunately, it turns out there is an easier way to do things; recently, ~botter-nidnul wrote up a guide to running Urbit inside a container with Docker Desktop, and with his blessing I am going to elaborate on it with step-by-step instructions.</description>

      <description>Late 2021 Note: This guide is now largely outmoded; Urbit now has official Windows binaries, and Port now has a native Windows installer    If you&amp;rsquo;re curious about Urbit but don&amp;rsquo;t know anything about running Linux binaries or don&amp;rsquo;t have a Mac, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to feel left out in the cold; Urbit runs just fine in WSL2 on Windows 10.
This tutorial will guide you through each step necessary to set up WSL and get an Urbit comet up and running.</description>
